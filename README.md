# Project Title:
# using Support vector Algorithm of Supervised Machine Learning ,predict "lris.csv"dataset to find out whether the species will be same or different

# TASKS:

task1:preprocess the data in skit.learn Library

task2:Load the data using sklearn modelselection default argument

task3:On the basis of your dataset Train,test and Split our SVM Model.

task4:Implement Support vector Mechanism classifier using svm_classfier, The svm must be "Linear"

task5:Train the classifer on Training Data

task6;Findout Prediction value on Testdata

task7;Test the model with the help of Accuracy ,Accuracy should lie in range

# conclusion: According to my Support Vector Mechanism model the species are Linear with the Accuracy of 1.00 Hence Proved model was succesfully Implemented
